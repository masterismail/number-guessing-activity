# Number Guessing Activity

This is a fun and engaging number-guessing activity currently under development for the Sugar learning environment.

## Getting Started

There are a few ways to access this activity, but here's the simplest method to get started:

**Prerequisites:**

* A computer with Git installed (https://git-scm.com/).

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Open a terminal window and run the following command to clone the number-guessing activity repository:

     ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:masterismail/number-guessing-activity.git
     ```

2. **Set Up the Sugar Environment:**

   To run Sugar activities, you'll need the Sugar development environment. Follow the instructions here to set it up: https://github.com/Anttwo/SuGaR/blob/main/view_sugar_results.ipynb

3. **Run the Activity:**

   Once you have the Sugar environment installed, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository:

     ```bash
     cd number-guessing-activity
     ```

   **Running Interactively:**

   You can run the activity interactively by starting the Sugar Terminal activity, then navigating to the activity directory and running the following command:

     ```bash
     sugar-activity .
     ```

   **(Optional): Running with Python Version**

   If the activity uses Python 2, the above command will work. If it uses Python 3, specify the version with this command:


     ```bash
     sugar-activity3 .
     ```

This will launch the number-guessing activity within the Sugar environment. You can now play the game and test its functionality.

**Note:**

Since the activity is under development, features and functionalities might change. This guide provides the simplest way to run the current version.
